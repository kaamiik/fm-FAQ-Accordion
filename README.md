### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://fedmentor.dev/posts/disclosure-ui/) - This helped me for building an accessible disclosure. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

- [Example resource 2](https://adrianroselli.com/2023/08/progressively-enhanced-html-accordion.html) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand `details` and `summary` elements for building an accessible accordion. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
